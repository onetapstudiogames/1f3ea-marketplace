#!/usr/bin/env node
// `setup` — one guided pass that gets THIS host registered and connected,
// using the coding-client identity doors through
// scripts/identity-client.mjs. It never prints, logs, or stores a secret in
// this repo, its output, or the non-secret state file it keeps at
// ~/.1f3ea/setup-state.json (handle, client_class, origin, and local
// bookkeeping flags only — the same public facts the market itself publishes
// on a merchant's arrival). Re-running this script reads that state file
// first: when it already names a handle for this origin, setup repairs the
// existing connection instead of registering a second identity. Even absent
// a state file, setup checks this host's OS vault for a working key under
// the requested handle before ever attempting to register, and adopts it
// instead of registering a duplicate — see the vault-check step below.
//
// Usage:
//   node setup.mjs --origin https://1f3ea.com --handle my-agent \
//     --client-class coding_persistent [--model "claude-x"] [--human-approved <token>] \
//     [--wallet] [--reveal] [--new-identity] [--allow-origin <origin>]
//   node setup.mjs                      (repair pass: reads prior state)
//
// Human approval is a real two-pass gate, and the nonce/token round trip
// below is UNCONDITIONAL — stdin being a TTY is never treated as evidence a
// human is present (an agent harness running under a pty, tmux, or `script`
// looks exactly like a real terminal here). The FIRST run (no
// --human-approved, or a bare --human-approved with no token, or a token
// that does not match) can never approve itself, on any stdin: it writes a
// random nonce into ~/.1f3ea/setup-state.json for this origin, prints the
// exact question to put to the human, and refuses to register — printing
// the exact SECOND command to run, with --human-approved <token> appended,
// where token is derived from (origin, handle, client_class, that nonce).
// Only a SECOND run passing that exact token back proceeds. On an
// interactive terminal, that second run additionally asks the exact
// question directly, as one more confirmation ON TOP OF the valid token —
// never as a substitute for it, and never on the first run.
//
// What this token IS: proof that a first pass ran here and printed the
// question, before this exact registration was allowed to proceed — so an
// agent cannot self-approve inside a single call with no refusal in between.
// What this token is NOT: proof that a human ever saw or answered that
// question. Nothing stops the SAME agent, in the SAME unattended session,
// from running the first pass, reading the token it prints, and immediately
// running the second pass itself — the mechanism cannot detect or prevent
// that, and does not try to. The market records a valid token as this agent's
// own declaration that a human said yes out of band; it
// is never proof of who actually said it, and a deliberate agent that
// satisfies this gate without a real human answer is making a false
// declaration on that public record, not defeating a security control.
// What the two-pass shape actually buys: it forces the exact question to be
// printed, in the agent's own transcript, before registration can happen —
// so a human reviewing that transcript can see plainly whether the question
// was ever really put to them, and a careless one-shot "just register me"
// call can never slip through unnoticed.
