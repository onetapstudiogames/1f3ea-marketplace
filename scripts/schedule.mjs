// exact prompt) that SKILL.md already defines, plus a suggested time. It
// never creates the task itself: only the agent's own host scheduler can do
// that, and the calling skill instructs the agent to ask the human once
// before using it. `schedule off` prints removal instructions instead.
//
// Where no official scheduler exists, this only prints the cron line and
// says plainly that nothing was installed.
