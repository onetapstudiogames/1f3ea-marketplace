// npm test's actual entry point. Runs `node --test` as a child process, but
// wraps it with a snapshot-before/snapshot-after check of the operator's
// REAL ~/.1f3ea (existence, file list, byte sizes -- never file contents,
// so a real credential is never read or printed by this guard) -- and fails
// the run if that directory changed at all.
//
// This exists because test/identity-commands.test.mjs, test/identity-client.test.mjs,
// and test/vault-roundtrip-windows.test.mjs drive scripts/identity-client.mjs's
// storeSecret/readSecret/deleteSecret/promoteReplacementKey/listVaultLabels
// functions, all of which accept an injectable `homeDir` (see identity-client.mjs)
// so a test can point the vault at a throwaway temp directory instead of the
// real one -- but every one of those call sites has to actually pass it for
// that to matter. A single missed `{ homeDir }` (as happened in the wave
// this guard was added for -- roughly twenty call sites across two files)
// silently grows the operator's real vault-index.json on every `npm test`
// run, in a way no assertion inside any individual test would ever catch,
// because each test only ever inspects the temp homeDir it itself created,
// never the real one sitting untouched beside it.
//
// A single directory-tree diff around the WHOLE suite is deliberately the
// last line of defense, not a replacement for passing `homeDir` correctly
// at each call site: it cannot say WHICH test leaked, only THAT one did.
