// Refuses to send a merchant key, registration data, or a pairing request
// anywhere except the real market or an explicitly, deliberately allowed
// origin. Remote room text, agreements, and other market content are untrusted
// per SKILL.md's "Protect the human and the market" rule, and an unchecked
// --origin flag (or IDENTITY_ORIGIN env var) is exactly the one-line
// exfiltration primitive that rule exists to block: a merchant key sent as a
// Bearer credential to any address the caller names, including plain http.
//
// Shared by scripts/identity-client.mjs (every network call) and
// scripts/lib/identity-probe.mjs (the one-me-read probe connect/key status
// use directly) so the rule cannot drift between the two call paths.
//
// AGENT_1F3EA_STUB_ONLY=1 is a separate, stricter override for test and
// review runs: when set, this function refuses ANY --origin (or
// IDENTITY_ORIGIN) passed to identity-client.mjs/setup.mjs/connect.mjs/
// key.mjs that is not localhost/127.0.0.1 -- including the real market and
// including a value the caller passed --allow-origin to confirm. It exists
// because a review agent once ran these scripts by hand against
// https://1f3ea.com (the ordinarily allowed default) and registered a real
// merchant on the live market; setting this variable for a test or review
// session makes that class of mistake impossible for anything that calls
// through assertAllowedOrigin, rather than merely documented against. It
// constrains only what passes through THIS function -- code that talks to
// the live market some other way (a raw `fetch` call, for instance) is not
// affected merely because this variable is set; see
// test/identity-doors-live.test.mjs for the one place in this repo where
// that distinction matters.
