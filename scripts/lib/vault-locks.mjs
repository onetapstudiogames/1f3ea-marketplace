// moment (a rotate and a register from two different sessions, or just two
// tests in this repo's own suite) can each read the same starting state,
// mutate their own copy, and write it back, with the second write silently
// discarding the first's change. lockWithRetry below closes that window
// with a plain `wx`-mode (O_EXCL) lockfile next to vault-index.json: only
// one process can ever hold that name at once, so a second one either waits
// briefly or, if the lock looks abandoned, breaks it and proceeds.

 * treated as abandoned (the process that created it crashed, was killed, or
 * otherwise never reached its own cleanup) and broken rather than honored
 * forever -- this file's own contents are always small and held only for the
 * few synchronous fs calls inside `fn`, so a real holder is never actually
 * still working after that long. Returns `undefined` (running `fn` not at
 * all) if the wait budget is exhausted without ever acquiring the lock,
 * rather than blocking indefinitely -- callers here already treat the whole
