 * process.env. This is what keeps a developer's own real
 * AGENT_1F3EA_SECRET or IDENTITY_ORIGIN, exported while working in this
 * shell, from silently reaching the identity client under test: neither
 * name appears here, so a child only ever sees them if a test's own `env`
 * overlay explicitly adds them.
 *
 * AGENT_1F3EA_STUB_ONLY=1 is set here by default: this makes every child
 * refuse any --origin that is not
 * localhost/127.0.0.1 (see scripts/lib/origin-guard.mjs), with no
 * --allow-origin exception, so a test that drives these scripts can never
 * reach the real market even by a typo or a copy-paste mistake. The handful
 * of tests in test/identity-commands.test.mjs that deliberately drive a
 * script against a fake, non-real https://example.invalid origin (to test
 * behavior unrelated to the origin guard itself -- flag parsing, printed
 * output shape, refusal wording) explicitly override this back to '0' in
 * their own `env`, with a comment explaining why: that origin can never
 * resolve to anything (reserved by RFC 2606) and is not the real market
 * either way, so the stricter guard is not needed there and would only
 * mask the behavior actually under test.

/**

 *
 * This must stay async (spawn, never spawnSync): several of these tests run
 * a stub HTTPS server in this same test process's event loop
 * (test/helpers/stub-market-server.mjs), and a synchronous spawnSync blocks
 * that entire event loop -- including the stub server -- for as long as the
 * child runs. A child that then tries to fetch from the stub server hangs
 * until its own request times out, because the parent process can never get
 * a turn to accept the connection and answer it. Using spawn (which yields
 * to the event loop while the child runs) is what lets the in-process stub
 * server actually respond.
 *
 * `env` is merged over `minimalBaseEnv()` above (not the full parent
 * process.env) so neither a test's fake HOME/USERPROFILE nor its absence of
 * AGENT_1F3EA_SECRET/IDENTITY_ORIGIN can be shadowed by the real ones this
 * test-runner process happens to have. NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 is
 * always set: every test here talks only to a stub server it started
 * itself, on 127.0.0.1/localhost, with a throwaway self-signed fixture cert
 * -- never a real host -- so trusting that cert is safe and deliberate, not
 * a production relaxation.
