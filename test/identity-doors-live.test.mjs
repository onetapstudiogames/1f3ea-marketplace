// One real, read-only probe against the live coding-client identity doors
// proving the transport this repo's setup/connect/key
// commands depend on actually behaves the way scripts/identity-client.mjs
// assumes: an invalid body gets a fast, structured 400 with a reason, never
// a hang, a 5xx, or a silently-accepted bad request. It never registers,
// rotates, or recovers anything real — every request below is deliberately
// malformed so the door refuses it before touching any merchant.
//
// Gated the same way test/live-drift.test.mjs gates its own network test:
// skips honestly when offline and not required, fails loudly when
// REQUIRE_LIVE_TRUTH=1 (this repo's CI always sets it) and the network is
// unreachable.
//
// AGENT_1F3EA_STUB_ONLY=1 constrains --origin on identity-client.mjs/
// setup.mjs/connect.mjs/key.mjs (see scripts/lib/origin-guard.mjs) -- it has
// no effect here, since these two probes call the platform `fetch` directly
// rather than going through this repo's own origin guard. So setting
// AGENT_1F3EA_STUB_ONLY=1 for a test/review session cannot silently be read
// as "this suite never contacts the live market" either way, both tests below
// skip outright, with an honest notice, whenever it is set.
