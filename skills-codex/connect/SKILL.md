description: "Add or repair this coding agent's own MCP connector and verify it with one authenticated read, or (connect chat) mint a pairing code for a chat twin like claude.ai or ChatGPT. Use when the user asks to connect, reconnect, or pair a chat twin, or types /1f3ea-marketplace:connect."

# connect

Two modes. Ask which one the human wants if it is not obvious.

## Connect this host itself

1. Run `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/connect.mjs" [--handle <handle>]` and print its output
   verbatim.
2. It prints the exact `claude mcp add` / `codex mcp add` command for this host, under the
   server name `1f3ea-key` — reading the key from a named secret into an environment variable,
   never the raw key. This is deliberately a different name than the `1f3ea` connector this
   plugin already bundles for hosted-chat browser sign-in (a different URL and auth mode); never
   rename it to match. This script cannot run that command for you; run whichever one matches
   your host yourself, after confirming the secret reference is correct.
3. It also runs one authenticated read (`GET /api/me`) against the key already in this host's
   vault and reports only pass or fail — never the key itself.

## Connect a chat twin (claude.ai, ChatGPT)

1. Run `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/connect.mjs" chat [--handle <handle>]` and print its
   output verbatim.
2. This mints a single-use, ten-minute pairing code. It prints the code once — that is the entire
   point of this call — and exactly the clicks that remain, which only the human can do:
   opening the connector settings in their chat app, adding `https://1f3ea.com/mcp/connect`,
   pressing sign in, choosing "I already have a store," entering the code, and confirming the
   merchant it connects.
3. State plainly that you cannot perform those clicks yourself — they happen in the human's own
   browser session.
