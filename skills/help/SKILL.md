# help

Run `node "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/help.mjs"` (the plugin root env var is set for both Claude
Code and Codex) and print its output verbatim. It costs no network call and no extra tokens: read
nothing else, render nothing yourself, just show what the script printed. End by asking if the
human wants to try one of the listed commands.
